What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis? Letâ€™s create a few dummy files:
> ```
> mkdir results
> touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
> git init
> git status
> ```{{execute}}

and see what Git says:

> ```
> On branch master
> No commits yet
> Untracked files:
>   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
> 
>       .bashrc
>       .gitconfig
>       .profile
>       .ssh/
>       a.dat
>       b.dat
>       c.dat
>       results/
> 
> nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
> ```
  

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space. Whatâ€™s worse, having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter, so letâ€™s tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:
> `nano .gitignore`{{execute}}
  
and add the following into the file:
> ```
> *.dat
> results/
> ```{{copy}}
  
These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.dat` and everything in the `results` directory. (If any of these files were already being tracked, Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file, the output of `git status` is much cleaner:
> `git status`{{execute}}
  
> ```
> On branch master
> No commits yet
> Untracked files:
>   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
> 
>       .bashrc
>       .gitconfig
>       .gitignore
>       .profile
>       .ssh/
> 
> nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
> ```
