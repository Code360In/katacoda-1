## Using Nano

Nano is a text editor to create, amend and update file content. To open `nano` with an empty buffer, we can just type `nano`{{copy}} in the terminal. You can also create a new buffer with the designated directory and filename. Let's make it to:
> `ls`{{execute}}
> 
> `nano helloworld/greetings.txt`{{execute}}

Let's take a look at the default nano screen.
