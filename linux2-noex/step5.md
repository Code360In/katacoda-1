## Hidden file 

We will create a hidden file (filename starts with dot character):
> `echo "Hello I am a hidden file." > .hidden.txt`{{execute}}

You will not see the file when you use the `ls` command:
> `ls`{{execute}}

Use the `-a` option of `ls` command to show all files (including the hidden files):
> `ls -a`{{execute}}
