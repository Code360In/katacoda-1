On a Ubuntu 18.04 system you can find a launcher for the terminal by clicking on the <b> Activities </b> item at the top left of the screen, then typing the first few letters of “terminal”, “command”, “prompt” or “shell”. Yes, the developers have set up the launcher with all the most common synonyms, so you should have no problems finding it.

Other versions of Linux, or other flavours of Ubuntu, will usually have a terminal launcher located in the same place as your other application launchers. It might be hidden away in a submenu or you might have to search for it from within your launcher, but it’s likely to be there somewhere.

If you can’t find a launcher, or if you just want a faster way to bring up the terminal, most Linux systems use the same default keyboard shortcut to start it: <b> Ctrl-Alt-T </b>. 

However you launch your terminal, you should end up with a rather dull looking window with an odd bit of text at the top, much like the image below. Depending on your Linux system the colours may not be the same, and the text will likely say something different, but the general layout of a window with a large (mostly empty) text area should be similar.

In Katacoda, we got a terminal for you to experience without opening one in your computer. 
Let’s run our first command. Click the mouse into the window to make sure that’s where your keystrokes will go, then type the following command, <b> all in lower case </b>, before pressing the <kbd> Enter </kbd> or <kbd> Return </kbd> key to run it.
