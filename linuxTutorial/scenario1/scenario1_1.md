The course is designed to get you into the groove of writing shell scripts and is, in essence, an example of the practical application of the shell script. You will learn an immense amount from doing the exercises and Labs. In the Labs, we begin by building a really simple script and progress to a script.

## Note 
At some time during this course you will need to log in as root. If you get to that point and are not the system administrator for the machine you are working on, then you may need to build your very own Linux machine. Any system administrator in their right mind would NEVER give you the root password. Of course, if you are the system administrator, you already have the root password!
