What does the w command do? You could run:
> `whatis w`{{execute}}

It should print some information about the `w` command:
> ```
> w (1)                - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
> ```

The `w` command not only tells us who are logged in, but also what they're doing. Are these users running applications? What actual processes are they running at this time? Perhaps someone's running an application like OpenOffice. `w` will tell us this.

If you look at the output of this command, it's got a list of headings that are fairly similar to the format of the who command.

Later we'll have a look at modifying the report columns, to get the output into a different format that may be more useful.
