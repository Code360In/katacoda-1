You can see the terminal is started on the right section. Let's run our first command. Make sure your keystrokes are on the terminal, then execute the following command:
> `pwd`{{execute}}

You should see a directory path printed out (probably something like `/root`).

From the picture, we have a couple of basics to understand. First is that when you type a commandit appears on the same line as the odd text. The $ is there to tell you the terminal is ready to accept a command. It is usually referred to as the **_prompt_**. The second thing to understand is that when you run a command any output it produces will usually be printed directly in the terminal, then another prompt is shown once it's finished. Some commands can output a lot of text, others will operate silently and wonâ€™t output anything at all.
